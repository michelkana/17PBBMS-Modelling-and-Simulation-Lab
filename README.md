# Welcome to 17PBBMS !

Hi! I am sharing my Labs notes from the course **17PBBMS - Modelování a simulace** for which I was lab tutor during Fall 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014.

**The Labs was held in the Czech language!** 

Please refer to [this page](https://predmety.fbmi.cvut.cz/cs/17pbbms) if you want to visit the official course page at the Czech Technical University.

The material here is provided with no warranty and might not reflect the current state of art in this research field. Please contact me and I will be glad to discuss.

# Syllabus

* Lab1: mathematical review, introduction to Matlab and Simulink
* Lab2: simulation of Malthus, logistic and descrete models with delay
* Lab3: simulation of Leslie model, Lotky – Volterry model
* Lab4: simulation of Kolmogorov model, epidemiology SIR model
* Lab5: simulation of simple compartemental models
* Lab6: analysis of multiple-compartment models and transfer function computation
* Lab7: analysis of linear-time-invariant LTI systems
